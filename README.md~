# Codes-for-Lane-Detection
Codes for the CNN-based lane detection models. (expected release date: 2018.11.20)

## Timeline

I will release the torch code in 2018.11.20. Tensorflow and pytorch version of the model will be released thereafter.

- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Models

### SCNN (Tensorflow, on-going)

Progress:
- [x] Define network architecture
- [x] Load pre-trained weights
- [x] Define dataloader (data augmentation [on-going])
- [x] Testing
- [x] Training
- [x] validation
- [ ] using multiple GPUs
- [ ] clean the codes and make them reproducible

Notes:

Please go to the [Tensorflow-SCNN](https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-Lane-Detection/tree/master/Tensorflow-SCNN) repo to see detailed instructions. 

### SCNN (Pytorch, on-going)

Progress:
- [ ] Define network architecture (VGG-16 + message passing)
- [ ] Load pre-trained weights
- [ ] Define dataloader (load images and labels + data augmentation)
- [ ] Testing (generate probability maps + smoothing)
- [ ] Training
- [ ] validation
- [ ] using multiple GPUs
- [ ] clean the codes and make them reproducible
