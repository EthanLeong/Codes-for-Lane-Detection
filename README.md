# Codes-for-Lane-Detection
Codes for the CNN-based lane detection models. (expected release date: 2018.11.20)

### Timeline
I will release the torch code in 2018.11.20. Tensorflow and pytorch version of the model will be released thereafter.

### Prerequisites
- [Torch](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

### Testing
To be released

### Training
To be released

### Tensorflow version of SCNN (single GPU)
Working in progress (2018.10.23 ~ 2018.11.20)

### Pytorch version of SCNN
Working in progress

### Acknowledgement
This repo is built upon [SCNN](https://github.com/XingangPan/SCNN) and [LaneNet](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/lanenet-lane-detection)
